# Churn-Prediction
Customer churn prediction with ANN.

**Dataset**: ChurModeling.csv <br/>
**Deep Learning Algorithm**: Artificial Neural Network <br/>
**Libraries**: TensorFlow 2.9.2, Keras

The Churn_Modeling dataset contains information about a bank's customers such as their Credit Score, Age, Tenure, balance, etc.

If we can predict which customers are more likely to leave the bank, we can plan a strategy to retain them, that's the GOAL!

**N.B.**: The data I have used do not come from a real company. Instead, they are fake data that simulate a real scenario.

**Important:** This notebook contains a lot of notes and comments. This is so that anyone can understand.
